# Quantitative-Resilience

This projects contains the codes used in the paper [Quantitative Resilience of Generalized Integrators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.04163) to be published soon in the IEEE Transactions of Automatic Control.

Codes for the octocopter study

1. The code 'actuator_dynamics.m' calculates and plots the input and vertical velocity and position depending on the type of inputs chosen.
2. The code 'translational_dynamics.m' calculates the resilience and time ratios for the translation dynamics in the case of the loss of control authority over each one of the propellers.
3. The code 'rotational_dynamics.m' calculates the resilience and time ratios for the rotation dynamics in the case of the loss of control authority over each one of the propellers.
